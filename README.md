# Selistock – The Celebrity Stock Market on Solana

Selistock is a Web3-powered platform that lets users buy and sell tokenized "shares" of celebrities and public figures. These shares reflect a celebrity's popularity, influence, and social relevance—allowing fans to invest in cultural momentum like never before.

Built on **Solana** for its blazing speed and ultra-low fees, Selistock aims to bring real-time market dynamics to the world of fame, fandom, and influence.

## 🌟 Why Selistock?

- **Gamified Investing** – Users "trade" celebrities like stocks based on real-time sentiment and social trends.
- **Tokenized Influence** – Each public figure has a unique token that fluctuates with community perception and engagement.
- **Built for the Masses** – Simple, fun, and social—Selistock is designed for global, non-crypto-native users.

## ⚙️ Why Solana?

Solana's speed and scalability make it the ideal home for Selistock's vision. With potentially millions of micro-transactions and live trading, we need a chain that can handle real-time, high-volume interactions at near-zero cost.
